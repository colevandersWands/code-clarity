# code-clarity

we give them a snippet of es6 code
1. they write tests for it
2. they convert it to es5 with the online babel converter, it should pass the same tests
3. they uglify it with the online uglifier, it won't pass the same tests so they need to go through and fix variable names
4. they manually de-uglify the code.  it should still pass the same tests

learning objectives
* first taste of es5 vs es6
* code readability
* practice refactoring
* reading and fixing errors (from step 3)
